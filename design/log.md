Morning thought - A good UX is like a smooth walking pace or even a dance
dare I say the best will let you run like the wind.

The history of computer UX, is filled with system that work as well as steady
state robots that can pause at any time. Their gate is awkward and slow.
The truth is, to walk, dance or run the system is never steady, it is always
transitioning, technically it is falling but that sounds odd, from state to
state. A marriage of intent with gravity and inertia. A good UX is the same
a learnable fluid physics that the human mind will enjoy.

gestures

- *Drag* sliding the object from start to finish
  *Fling* momentary sliding of the object that end with enogh speed that the
  object has inertia

  *Flick* shorter than an fling, link a thump or pop. The intent is not about
  where you want the object to end up, other than you want it done.
